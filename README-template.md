### Overview

This page is a landing page of a basic landing for a website. The is ample emphasis on it responsiveness as highlighted in the design but there are some subtle part that add beauty to this basic design. It starts with an overlay on the all pictures on the site, then there in the hover state for the for the Pictures and links. It is a nice page to view and I am glad I was able to do this challenge.   

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

I developed this landing Page using HTML, CSS and Javascript. HTML is used for the page content, CSS for style(and responsive) and Javascript is use for the Navbar Behaiviour on click. The entire page is made to be in the middle. The content contain about 85% of the width. 

I divided the HTML page into three(3) main section; header, main, and footer. The Header content the contain the NavBar and the hero section, It has a large background Image which was overlaid to make it darker. It was styled appropriately to ensure it is responsive and works with other screen sizes. The Navbar works has a Web and Mobile version both line on top of the screen. 

Its Main section contain the Picture with the text and the Image Grid. The Picture is styled with the text absolutely and placed at the bottom. The image grid has each of its images with and overlay to appear darker and a hover effect. 

The footer section is made with grid. The grid is designed appropriately for mobile and web version of the website.

The Javascript works simply, It gets class and it listen for click on the Navbar Hamburger Menu to generate the Nav-links. 






### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Javascript 

### What I learned

I learnt the proper use of HTML and CSS for landing page. The core principles to observe and the use of the right html semantics to ensure ease in readability by other programmers. I believe other programmer should not have problem maintaining this page.

I also learn problem solving is a skill that should not neglected because while I working on certain feature on the page, I ran into problem that I had to fix by having to read about some properties again and watch some online tutorial. A vivid example is the hamburger menu which  is shown in the navBar section of the header and the overlay.   

<!-- Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
``` -->

### Continued development

I was expecially intrigued on working on the grid section in the future. I suppose the section can designed to image from other sources and have it content change dynamically.
